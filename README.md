# DIY Home Lab Mini Rack

CAUTION: This is just an idea at the moment. Follow this at your own risk.

## Requirements

1. Top Shelf for Wifi
2. Loosely based on [Desk Pi Rackmate T1](https://wiki.deskpi.com/rackmate/)
3. Rack Units
    - 1U Keystone Patch Panel. Blank to begin with. 
    - 1U 16 port Switch [8 PoE]
    - 1U for Pi Cluster
    - 2U Rackmount mini ITX for Turing Pi Cluster
    - 1U Power strip? These are expensive.
    - 4U Bottom Shelf to house 2 NAS. Maybe top shelf?

4. Size?
    - 6U is small and ideal but will only adrress Wifi/Router/Internet plus one pi cluster
    - 8U is idea size but wont fit 2 NAS
    - 10U is best avoided.
