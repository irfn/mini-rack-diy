# DIY Home Lab Mini Rack

CAUTION: This is just an idea at the moment. Follow this at your own risk.

## Requirements

1. Top Shelf for Wifi
2. Loosely based on [Desk Pi Rackmate T1](https://wiki.deskpi.com/rackmate/)
3. 9U Rack Units
    - 2U Top Shelf to house 2 NAS and Wifi
    - 1U Keystone Patch Panel. Blank to begin with. 
    - 1U 16 port Switch [8 PoE]
    - 1U for Pi Cluster
    - 1U for Mac mini
    - 2U Rackmount mini ITX for Turing Pi Cluster
    - 1U Power strip? These are expensive.
    - Side Noctua Fans

4. Size Considerations
    - mini ITX case fit
    - 9U height is approx 18 inch height
    - Standard Rack Width. 19 inch Rail width, 1 inch extra. Approx 20 inch width
    - Try to reduce depth like Rackmate, perhaps keep 305 mm (12 inch) max

## Checks

1. mini ITX compatible case

## Price Estimates

This Estimate is meant to be indicative as actual prices will vary as theseprices are based on amazon.in
and should be much lesser at a Hardware shop

### Rack Frame Estimate
1. Aluminium Extrusion
    - 18x4 + 19x4 + 12x4 = 196inch ~ 5000mm = 559/900mm = 3105 ~ Rs 3200
2. 4x 3way Corner connector = 2x599 = 1198
3. M5 Nut M5 Threaded Pre Assembly T-Nut =  2x399 (25 each) [Approx 4 x 9U = 32 + 4x3 = 12 = 44] ~ Rs 798
2. M5 X 10mm Button Head Allen Hex Socket = 342(50) = Rs 342

Approx 5538
